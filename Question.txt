Question No 04:  	 	 								[08 marks]
As you know now a days the world is going through the COVID-19 pandemic. People are getting themselves tested to see if they have corona virus or not. If they have positive result they are being isolated in Quarantine Centers otherwise they are sent to their homes with safety precautions. 

In view of this scenario identify and implement data structure(s) that handles the people coming for tests. If result is positive, person is sent to the quarantine center and if result is negative, person is sent to home. Keeping this managed the first person who comes for the test will have the results first then others one by one and the first person sent to the quarantine center will recover first and sent to the home. When person is sent to home we have no concern if the first person entered home will leave first or last person entered will leave first. They will stay home and stay safe. Example Scenario shown below. 
Note: The person have a name, gender, age, test type, results. Test type should be set to by default value “Corona Test”
